# 🎒 RSGCore - Player Weight and Slots Enhancer

Hello everyone!

This is a helper script designed to support the new feature of **individual weight and slot limits per player**.

## 🔧 How It Works

The script works in a simple way:
- When the player **uses a specific item** (configured in `config.lua`), the script will **increase the player's maximum weight or slots** accordingly.
- There are **limits for both weight and slots** to prevent players from carrying the entire world on their backs.

## ⚙️ Optional Behavior

You can enable the config option `Config.WipeAllWhenRespawn` to **reset the player's weight and slots** back to the default values set in `PlayerDefault` from `rsg-core`.

## 📦 Requirements

- [`rsg-inventory`](https://github.com/Rexshack-RedM/rsg-inventory) **version 2.5.1 or higher**
- [`rsg-core`](https://github.com/Rexshack-RedM/rsg-core) **version 2.3.0 or higher**

## 🤝 Contributions

Feel free to open Pull Requests with improvements or use this script as you wish – just **keep the original credits** intact.

Happy scripting, and enjoy!
